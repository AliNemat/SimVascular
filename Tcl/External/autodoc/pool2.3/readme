	Collection of tcl procedures, classes and widgets ([Script]Pool)
		(Version 2.3 / September 14, 2000)

		Andreas Kupries	(a.kupries@westend.com)

This directory contains a collection of hopefully useful tcl procedures,
classes and widgets. They are split into 4 Packages, to have at least a
little organization.

For a simple install just unpack into a directory of your choice, make it your
working directory, then type 'make install'. This will install the applications
under 'apps' into /usr/local/bin, the packages will go into subdirectories of
/usr/local/lib. You must be root to do the last step, of course.

For a nonstandard installation you have to edit the Makefile, just point
$exec_dir to a directory of your choice (Tcl should search it for
packages). Alternatively change $BIN_DIR and $LIB_DIR.


Enjoy,
	Andreas
