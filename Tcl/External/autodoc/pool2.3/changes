Changes from 2.2

*	Some fixes from Sebastien BARRE <sbarre@claranet.fr> to make
	it better behaved on Win* systems.

*	Contributions to the date functionality by Ric Klaren
	<klaren@cs.utwente.nl>.

Changes from 2.1

*	Will Duquettes new text about object commands got me thinking
	about nested classes, objects in namespaces and whether my OO
	system would be able to handle such. Found out that the answer
	was *No*. Fixed the problems preventing it.

	*INCOMPATIBILITY*
	
	The internal (compiled) form of classes changed. This means,
	that all applications using my OO system and the feature of
	precompiling classes have to recompile them. Applications using
	the OO system without precompilation do not have to do anything.

	An example for an application hit by the incompatibility is my
	AutoDoc. A new version will be released together with this
	version of Pool.

Changes from 2.0

*	Bug fixes in Pool_Base (OO) and Pool_Gui.

*	Better installation procedure. Figures out location of
	tclsh/wish by itself now, and fixes the #!-definitions
	in all applications before installing them.


Changes from 1.0

*	All procedures placed into namespaces.

*	New OO kernel making use of namespaces.

*	All classes rewritten to take advantage of the new features
	(Easy access to options, instance variables, methods, arrays
	as instance variables).

*	Moved OO kernel and log facility into Pool_Base.
	Obsoleted Pool_OO and Pool_Log.

*	NEW:	Regular expressions for recognition of ftp, file,
		http, gopher, mailto, news, wais and prospero urls.


Changes from 0.5

*	Code freeze, start working on version completely using namespaces.

*	Faster 'string_rep', new procedure 'string_uncap', more
	namespace aware functionality (tcl 8.x):
		descend8, array8, cgi8, getopt8, replace8.

Changes from 0.4

*	Fixed some undesirable properties of the mail system exposed by the
	newsbot:

	-	Alternative SMTP spooler with limited degree of
		parallelism. POPeye changed to use it. No more trying to
		send out hundreds of mail in parallel.

	-	Prevent execution of SMTP spooler while another is still
		running.

*	Fixed another bug in the recovery part of the pop retriever. Caused
	deletion of valid mail.

*	Added some generic dialogs to Pool_GuiBase. They were written as
	part of CSS and are now in the proper location.


*	Started usage of namespaces. The relevant files all end in '8' as
	their code is understood by tcl 8.x interpreters only.


Changes from 0.3

* Bugfixes.

* Extended documentation (class members and options (parameters)).

* More generic widget classes.

* More string/file procedures, enabled dumping of data structures
  (variables, procedures, namespaces) into evaluable strings.


Changes from 0.2

* Made 'popeye' more robust against problems in the storage subsystem,
  fixed problem with recovery handling too.

* Added smtp spooler to 'popeye'. This part will transfer all messages
  waiting in a configured directory to the POP-host. After reconfiguration
  of Smail, sendmail, ... to queue remote mail in this directory the
  local mail system is completely decoupled from network access. Especially
  handy in conjunction with 'diald' and periodic polling of the external
  mailbox.


Changes from 0.1

* Fixed minor bugs in code and documentation of Base, GuiBase, Log, OO.

* Added section 'net' (= package Pool_Net).

	Contains procedures to handle network protocols.
	Currently implemented:
		SMTP client code, POP3 client and server core code,
		mini (nano?) name service.

* More applications

	POP3 client, server, graphical based management of these.

	The POP3 client (POPeye) is in use here at home to fetch my mail.
	The server (POPsy) was written to debug it.
