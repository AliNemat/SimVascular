definitionList {
    defterm apps/gen_cls "
    Invoked without arguments. Searches the directory hierarchy
    beginning at the current working directory for '.cls'-files
    and compiles the contained class definitions (see
    [pkgRef Pool_Base]) into pure tcl. The compilation result
    of file [strong X.cls] is stored into [strong X.tcl].
    Additionally generates the file [strong clsIndex] in
    the current working directory, an index of the found classes.
    "

    defterm apps/gen_idx "
    Invoked without arguments. Searches the directory hierarchy
    beginning at the current working directory for '.tcl'-files
    and generates a [strong tclIndex] suitable for autoloading.
    Recognizes standard procedures, classes as above (gen_cls),
    aliases and usage of all class instantiation commands defined in
    [strong clsIndex] (see above).
    "

    defterm apps/gen_pkg "
    Invoked as 'gen_pkg packagename packageversion indexfile'.
    Generates [strong pkgIndex.tcl] from 'indexfile'
    (usually [strong tclIndex]).
    "

    defterm apps/nserver "
    Called without arguments. Should be put into background. Uses
    [pkgRef Pool_Net]/ns/* to create a simple name server.
    "

    defterm apps/nwho "
    Called without arguments. Connects to a running [strong nserver]
    and lists all registered applications, together with their port
    numbers.
    "

    defterm apps/mail_sendfile "
    Invoked as 'mail_sendfile -to recipient \[-from sender\]
    \[-talkto host\] file... Prepends each of the listed files with
    a mail header, then sends them via SMTP at the given host to
    the specified recipients. The sender defaults to the invoker,
    and the host to 'localhost'. The argument to '-to' may contain
    a valid tcl list. The file(s) are then send to each of the
    addresses on the list.
    "

    defterm apps/popsy "
    A small POP3 server, written mainly for testing purposes (popeye).
    Built around the server core code in [fileRef net/pop3/server.cls],
    uses [fileRef net/adb.cls] and [fileRef net/pop3/mbox.cls]
    as well. Registers itself at 'nserver', see above. Can be remote
    controlled because of this, see next 2 entries. The available
    interface is described in [xRef popsy_interface]. $pbreak$pbreak

    Invoked as 'popsy ?-userdb filename? ?-mailfolder path? ?-port number?'.
    $pbreak$pbreak
    Reads '~/.popsyrc' too. See [fileRef apps/dotpopsyrc] for an
    example. Hard coded defaults (lowest priority) are /var/adm/pop_userdb,
    /var/spool/mail and pop3.
    "

    defterm apps/popsy_man "
    Mini utility to control a running popsy process. Command line based.
    Invoke without arguments, then use '?' or 'h' to get help.
    "

    defterm apps/popsymon "
    The big brother to 'popsy_man'. GUI based application to monitor and
    control a running popsy process. Invoked without arguments. This
    application uses [depRef Tktable], the spreadsheet extension
    by [xRef jhobbs].
    "

    defterm apps/popeye "A pop3 client based upon
    [fileRef net/pop3/client.cls], in the tradition of 'fetchmail', 'suck',
    etc. Uses the smtp interface ([fileRef net/smtp/]) to deliver
    fetched mail locally, after appropriate munging of 'To:' header. The
    currently used classificator accepts all mail. Registers itself at
    'nserver', see above. Can be remote controlled because of this, see next
    entry. The available interface is described in
    [xRef popeye_interface]. Other controllers I can think of are cron,
    with some intermediary shell/tcl script, or tkgoodstuff. $pbreak$pbreak
    
    Invoked as 'popeye ?-user name? ?-password string? ?-host name?
    ?-auth upass/apop? ?-to mailaddress? ?-port number? ?-use-top-for-retr 0/1?'.
    $pbreak$pbreak
    Reads '~/.popeyerc' too. See [fileRef apps/dotpopeyerc] for an
    example. Hard coded defaults (lowest priority) for -auth, -use-top-for-retr,
    -port and -host only (upass, 0, pop3, localhost). $pbreak$pbreak

    [strong Important:] apop authentication requires the packages
    [depRef Trf] and  [depRef Memchan]. $pbreak$pbreak

    Setting '-use-top-for-retr' to 1 forces the system to use 'TOP x 0' instead
    of 'RETR x'. It is in here because my provider had a brain dead pop3 server
    for some time. It didn't accept RETR, but delivered the whole mail if 0
    was given as 2nd argument to TOP. I don't know wether similar versions of
    this server are lurking out there, but better be prepared. This option
    should be left alone under normal circumstances.
    "

    defterm apps/popeyemon "
    A simple graphical monitor to watch a running popeye process. Invoked
    without arguments.
    "

    defterm apps/popeye_trigger "
    Simple tcl script to trigger a fetch cycle of popeye. Add to crontab for
    regular execution (see [fileRef apps/my.crontab] for an example).
    Invoked without arguments.
    "
}


par "
Remarks:
popeye, popeyemon and popeye_trigger are in actual use here at home,
fetching the mail from my provider ([xRef westend])."

par "
Idea: delay trigger 'flist'-operation of exmh after each fetch cycle.
