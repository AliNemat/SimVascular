par "
The server core is derived from the general [classRef server] class. It
handles only the details of the POP3 connection and protocol. The task of
authenticating a user attempting a login is done in here, but the data used by
the process is retrieved from an external object obeying the interface as
described in [classRef userdbBase] and specified to the core via the option
[optionRef pop3Server userdb]. Access to the messages stored an user is
mediated through another external object, its handle given to the core by
[optionRef pop3Server storage] and derived from [classRef popServerStorageBase]
"

par "
Example implementations of a user database and a storage subsystem are
[classRef aDB] and [classRef mbox]."

par "
They were used to build [fileRef apps/popsy], a complete small
scale pop server.
