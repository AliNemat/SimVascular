par "
Each of the procedures defined in [fileRef base/cgi.tcl]
falls into one of 2 categories:
"

enumerate {
    item "Support of multi-page generation, or"
    item "
    support of redirection of output into
    strings, with later retrieval of the saved code.
    "
}

par "The following combinations are possible:"

itemize {
    item "Use only the procedures of one category."
    item "
    Start with multi-page generation, then use the
    string support between open/close file
    "
    item "
    Start with string support, then open/close files as desired
    "
}

par "
A deeper nesting is (currently) [strong not] possible. So please
don't try to open a file, stack some string buffers and then open
another file.
"

section "Some remarks"

par "
The benefit of multi-page support should be obvious,
but why the support of stacked string buffers ?
"

par "
Well, some of the commands in the [xRef cgilib] (made by
[xRef libes]) don't evaluate their input, but take preformatted
text only. An example of this are [strong cgi_li] and
[strong cgi_term_definition]. This prevents the deeper nesting of
list structures, although possible in native HTML. The redirection
into strings now allows pre-generation of the nested parts and their
insertion whereever desired.
