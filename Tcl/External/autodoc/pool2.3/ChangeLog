Mon Jul 31 21:02:10 2000  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/lists.tcl: 
	* base/math.tcl: Updated to contain the newest email address of
	  Brent Welch.

	* base/date.tcl (weekday, printCalendar): Added contribution from
 	  Ric Klaren <klaren@cs.utwente.nl>.

Sun Jul 30 22:51:50 2000  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/misc.tcl (logName, realName): Changed to allow windows more
 	  leeway. Patch from Sébastien Barré <sbarre@claranet.fr>.

	* base/file.tcl (descendDirs): Sébastien Barré
 	  <sbarre@claranet.fr> sent a patch to deactive the inode-checking
 	  on non-unix platforms as they don't have that concept (and no
	  way to create circular references in a filesystem).

Sun Dec 19 20:55:35 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* doc/app_popeye.doc: Added user documentation for Popeye.

	* gui/nlistbox.tcl: Added missing documentation.

	* gui/action.cls: Fixed documentation problem.

Sun May 16 10:18:15 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* gui/ui.tcl: Fixed incorrect variable reference in namespace
	  initialization code.

Sat Feb 20 15:13:06 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/oo.tcl: Fixed errors in the various chaining code
	  (chain, chainToSuper, chainToDerived, destructors, constructors)
 	  introduced by the new namespace features.
	  (support::delete) Fixed error leaving the object command lying
 	  around.

Tue Feb 16 21:31:16 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/oo.tcl (chain): New, general chaining of method calls.
  	  Bugfix: Changed names of procedures imported from superclasses,
 	  substituting @ for :: to prevent access problems due to
 	  misintepretation as namespace (which does not exist).

Mon Feb 15 13:51:43 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* ----------------------------------------------------------

	* V 2.2 ready for distribution.

Sun Feb 14 15:00:59 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/oo.tcl (::pool::oo::support::GetObject): Fixed error
	  preventing the use of objects in namespaces.
	  (cons/des): Constructors and destructors are now internally
	  called by that name. The old interface (constructor = method
	  with name equal to class, destructor same with prepredend ~)
	  remains in place for backward compatibility. The internal class
	  compiler will do the conversion. Addtionally a new interface was
	  created, the declaration procedures 'constructor' and
	  'destructor'). Reason behind the change: The old convention
	  prevented the use of classes in namespaces (like xml::parser),
	  creation and usage of the construcor/destructor methods was
	  imossible due to the '::' embedded into them.

	* base/cgi_opt.tcl: New, from January 22, 1999. Another option
	  processor. Uses some functionality from 'getopt'. Processes
	  options of the form 'option=value' instead of '-option
	  value'. Useful for new (highlevel) cgi commands allowing them to
	  blend in with the base commands.

	* base/dump.tcl (::pool::dump::namespace): Removed a 'filter'
	  statement and replaced it with a foreach-loop computing the list
	  directly. See the marker <enhance@14/1999/ak>.

	* base/lists.tcl (::pool::list::prepend): Added, it is the
	  same as ::pool::list::unshift, just under a different name. 
	  (::pool::list::select): Added, really new, author Christopher
	  Nelson <chris@pinebush.com>.

Thu Nov 12 22:45:07 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* clock/monthListTix.cls (createSubwidgets): Delayed definition
	  of -command for the 'tixComboBox'. Was called by tix to early,
	  while the surrounding widget was incompletely constructed and
	  its method dispatcher procedure not yet available.

Sun Oct 18 17:07:13 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* apps/gen_idx: Fixed 'if' without braces around its expression.

Thu Oct  1 21:07:01 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* tests/all: enhanced to allow the execution of the tests for an
	  uninstalled Pool distribution.

Wed Sep 30 18:36:18 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Makefile (fix-hashbang-line): New target. Called before
	  installation, fixes the #!-path in all applications.

	* apps/fixhbline: New. Takes tclsh/wish locations and fixes the
	  first line of the given application script to point to the
	  correct interpreter binary.

	* apps/findinpath: New. Tcl-equivalent to 'which', finds an application
	  by searching through the PATH variable and the listed
	  directories.

	* Makefile (test-prepare): Changed to use the applications in the
	  distribution for

Fri Aug 28 00:18:52 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* gui/gPopupMenu.cls: Resolved spelling discrepancy (m vs. _m)

Sat Jun  6 15:03:47 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* ----------------------------------------------------------

	* V 2.0 ready for distribution.

Thu Jun  4 20:00:59 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Prepared for distribution in the last couple of days, installed
	  locally, ironed out some newly introduced and overlooked bugs in
	  the mail system.

Wed May 27 20:32:44 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/urls.tcl (wais regexp 'schemepart'): Changed to reduce
	  number of parentheses. First try had too many and 'regexp'
	  balked. Found while testing the adapted 'makedist'.

	* base/string.tcl (hangingIndent): New, similar to 'indent', but
	  skips the first line of the given paragraph.

Tue May 26 23:42:30 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/oo.tcl (SetupOptions): Fixed scoping problem. Made access
	  to namespace local 'option' procedure, wanted global version.

Thu May 21 01:01:42 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* ----------------------------

	* base/file.tcl (descendDirs): Steve Cariglia
	  (sjc@hyperion.haystack.mit.edu) pointed out a small buglet in this
	  procedure. Have to take device into account while looking for
	  loops as inodes are unique only within a device.

	* doc/net_pop3s.doc, net/pop3c.doc: See below.

	* doc/net_pop3.doc: More content adaptions.

Wed May 20 00:16:25 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* doc/net_pop3(c).doc: Updated the pop3 descriptions to have them
	  compile without flaw. Content adaptions are still
	  required. Most of the time went into extending AutoDOC, to
	  handle images better, as part of its cross reference system.

Tue May 19 19:25:43 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* apps/popeye, apps/popeyemon: Changed logging system to use
	'remoteLog'.

Mon May 18 22:12:30 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Class, file, procedure documentation complete, fixed any missing
	  things shown by autodoc.

Sun May 17 22:30:59 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* More documentation, now the pop3 part.

Thu May 14 21:25:11 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Got around to finishing the documentation of Pool_Net. Toplevel
	  is ok now, as is the smtp subdirectory.

Wed Apr 22 01:18:29 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* apps/popeye: Added triggerStorage to system. The script given to
	  it (-command) calls 'exmh_triggerfetch', thus obviating the need
	  manual or periodic checking of the folder hierarchy. It is done
	  exactly when required.

	* net/pop3/storage/trig.cls: New storage class. Basically forwards
	  incoming messages to a specified storage (option -target).
	  Additionally detects the delivery of the last message to the
	  storage and then evaluates the '-command'-script.

	* net/pop3/client.cls: Added option '-on-login'. Contains script,
	  is evaluated after a successful login to the pop server.
	  Arguments: pop client and #'messages' found.
	  (ClearSocket): Overidden to allow evaluation of script stored in
	  new option '-done'. Signals completion of a POP3 session.

	* apps/exmh_triggerfetch: New, triggers a folder scan in all
	  running exmh applications.

	* net/pop3/*.cls, net/apps/pop*: Ironed out bugs in server and
	  client. Both are functional now again (includes recovery
	  system).

	* ---- Evening again ----
	
	* Testing new pop client, server now.

	* base/remoteLog.cls: new class, encapsulates functionality for
	  logging syslog calls to a socket. Factored out of
	  'apps/popsy'. Used by 'apps/nserver'. Adaption of other servers
	  will follow soon.

	* apps/nsmon: New application, monitors a running nameserver.

	* apps/popeye_trigger: Changed to use new nameserver.

	  state flag as accepted by most widgets (normal, disabled)

	* base/lists.tcl (exchange): new, exchanging an element of a list
	  against a new value.

	* base/getopt.tcl (changeDefault): new procedure, easy changing of
	  default values associated to options.

	  into classes, files renamed to *.cls.

	* apps/popsy_man, apps/popsymon: Adapted to changes in nameserver
	  interface and logger widget. Nothing else required.

	  incoming mail.

	* net/pop3/classifyBase.cls: Interface to message classificator,
	  as seen by the POP3 client core in 'client.cls'.

	  avoid confusion between server and client storage systems.

	* net/pop3/cltStorBase.cls: Interface to storage system, as seen
	  by the POP3 client core in 'client.cls'.

	* net/pop3/client.cls: Was 'client.tcl', rewritten into class
	  (derived from <c pop3Connection>).

Sun Apr 19 12:54:40 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* apps/popsy: Adapted to changes in pop server. Fixed spelling
	  problems in base/oo.tcl, net/server.cls, net/pop3/server.cls,
	  net/pop/storBase.cls and net/pop/mbox.cls (rename => ::rename,
	  delete => dele, pop3_server => pop3Server).

	* net/pop3/*.cls: Rewriting the existing code into classes
	  (pop3Connection, protocol sequencers). Nearly complete,
	  only highlevel control is missing.

	* net/pop3/mbox.cls: Was 'net/mbox_man.tcl'. Rewritten into a
	  class, derived from 'popStorageBase', see below. Changed to
	  allow more than one transfer in progress.

Sat Apr 18 21:35:01 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* apps/gen_cls: Added code to traverse an entire directory
	  hierarchy in search of files to compile. Invoke by '-R'

	* apps/gen_idx: Class definitions now export only the name of
	  their class and the entrypoint for the autoloader as

	  indices is reduced too.

	* base/sequencer.cls, net/smtp/*.cls: Fixed some kinks introduced
	  during the rewrite.

	* apps/mail_sendfile: Adapted to changes in the SMTP system.

	* gui/*.cls, clock/*.cls: Documentation fixes. Completed in this
	  area. The only things left are in 'net'. Substantial parts of
	  that wait for rewriting into classes too (sequencer base, server
	  base, pop & smtp sequencers, mail storage, ...).

Fri Apr  3 23:45:00 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

Mon Nov 24 23:33:53 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* The changes below were required to avoid flooding the remote
	  host (and my pop3 retriever) in case of many outgoing mails (>
	  50). Such big bundles are produced by the c.l.t.welcomebot (news
	  bot to welcome first time posters to the c.l.t newsgroup). The
	  second day produced 175 mails. The remote host handled this, but
	  with considerable slow down. My pop3 retriever was starved
	  completely. This will not happen anymore now.

	* apps/popeye: Changed to use the new mail spooler, see
	  below. Reconfigures this spooler to send 2 messages in parallel.

	* net/smtp/spool_serial.tcl: New spooler for outgoing mail. No
	  unlimited parallelism as in 'net/smtp/spool.tcl'. Option
	  -par allows to configure the degree of parallelism. Internal
	  default: 1 == Complete serialization of outgoing mail.

Fri Nov  7 19:34:52 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/mail/message8.tcl: See last last entry below. Namespace is
	'::mail'.

Wed Oct 29 22:40:58 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/*8.tcl: New files. Functionality of files without
	  '8'-suffix, but moved into appropriately named namespaces
	  (::list, ::string, ::dump, ::serial).

Thu Oct 23 13:39:30 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* gui (Added files): Some generic dialogs: dialog_choice.cls,
	  dialog_info.cls, dirchoice.cls, file_prop.cls, generic_mbar.cls,
	  generic_popup.cls, generic_prop.cls. All copied from
	  'CSS/apps/lib'.
	
Wed Oct 22 14:28:09 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Added documentation of class options and members, as required by
	  the new version of 'AutoDoc'.

	* base/dump.tcl: New file, contains all datastructure dumpers from
	  'CSS/lib/common.tcl'.

	* base/misc.tcl: Added 'isnumber' predicate. Source file as
	  before, see below.

	* base/string.tcl: Added string procedures from file
	  'CSS/lib/common.tcl'.

Tue Oct 21 10:59:42 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* oo/*: Fixed 'object_savedef'. Could not handle compiled classes
	  and superclasses in separate files. Actually done around 'Oct
	  15' as part of working on CSS.

Sat Oct  4 14:38:43 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* oo/o_interp.tcl, oo/o_compile.tcx: Added 'class_initialization'
	  procedure, to allow specification of global, class specific
	  initialization scripts.

Fri Oct  3 00:27:15 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* gui/sep.tcl (separator_grid): Corrected wrong varname:
	  $name -> $w. Changed width/height/sticky attributes to force a
	  thin line.

Fri Aug 29 23:00:50 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/descend.tcl (file_followlink): Erroneous behaviour if given
	  a regular file. Fixed now.
	  (file_normalize_path): Handles leading ..'s now.
	  (file_resolve_links, file_realname): New procedures, based on
	  code by Maurice Diamantini <diam@ensta.fr>.

Sat Aug 16 15:33:35 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/pop3/client.tcl (_pop3_initiate_recovery): found the error
	  preventing proper recovery. Forgot to unlock the
	  scheduler. Tasks were added, but the scheduler was not started
	  because of this.

	* apps/popeye: see below.

	* net/smtp/spool.tcl: tested, removed some misspellings preventing
	  proper operation.

	* apps/popeye: Added configuration and code to use the new
	  spooler, see below. Messages residing in a specific directory
	  are send to the configured mailhost. This is done in parallel to
	  sucking newly arrived mail.

	* net/smtp/spool.tcl: New file, implements smtp-based message
	  spooler.

Sat Aug  9 00:04:08 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Background to latest changes: Had loss of data after inc'ing
	  mail in exmh while retrieval was still running. The added log
	  information clearly shows that a connection to the smtp demon
	  locks up immediately after creation, all following connection
	  attempts are then refused. Proper error handling and additional
	  modes of message storage (net/storage/dir.tcl, etc.) solved the
	  immediate problem of information loss, but not the primary lock
	  up. I believe it to be releated to file/directory locking, as it
	  is caused by emxh integrating mail with retrieval running. It is
	  no problem of sending more than one mail via smtp at a time. The
	  logs had examples of up to 3 simultaneous smtp transfers.

	* net/storage/multi.tcl, smtp.tcl: Removed some errors, tested in
	  popeye, against popsy.

	  The situation causing loss of data with old popeye was
	  reproducible, and therefore checked. Loss of data does not occur
	  anymore.

Thu Aug  7 23:23:10 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* apps/popeye: Changed storage system to use multi storage in
	  combination with smtp, directory and memory. Should not loose
	  mail now.

	* net/storage/multi.tcl: Special storage facility. Sequentially
	  tries all registered sub facilities until a sucessful one is hit.

	* net/storage/*: New directory, new files. Several facilities to
	  store incoming messages in various ways (append to file, file in
	  a directory, in memory, transfer via smtp).

	* net/smtp/*: Added syslog calls at strategic places.

Sat Aug  2 21:35:28 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/string.tcl (string_replace): New function. Works like
	  'lreplace', but for strings. 

Thu Jul 31 21:43:47 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* base/descend.tcl (file_normalize_path, file_normalize_unix_path):
	  Added normalization of paths (files and internet urls). 

Wed Jul 30 22:38:47 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/pop3/client.tcl (_pop3_task): RETR has same priority as DELE
	  now.

	* base/cgi.tcl (cgi_tools_get_string): New procedure. Wrapper
	  around 'cgi_tools_open_string' and 'cgi_tools_close_string'.
	  Simplifies usage, ensures correct nesting.

Thu Jul  3 23:06:45 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Added missing documentation, as found by AutoDOC. Corrected
	  spelling errors in documentation.

Tue Jul  1 18:17:29 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/pop3/server.tcl: Added code to '_pop3s_top' to interpret
	  'TOP x 0' as 'RETR x'. 'RETR x' is still available, of course.

	* apps/popeye:       Added option '-use-top-for-retr'. See below.

	* net/pop3/base.tcl: Added option '-use-top-for-retr'. See below.

	* net/pop3/retrieve.tcl: Added option '-use-top'. Default is
	  0. Setting to 1 forces the system to use 'TOP x 0' instead of
	  'RETR x'. Reason: My provider had a brain dead pop3 server some
	  time. It didn't accept RETR, but delivered the whole mail if 0
	  was given as 2nd argument to TOP. I don't know wether similar
	  versions of this server are lurking out there, but better be
	  prepared.

Sun Jun 29 16:11:35 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* doc/: Completed POP documentation.

Sat Jun 28 19:55:56 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/popeye, net/popeyemon: Added monitor application for popeye.

Fri Jun 27 23:14:08 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/popsymon, popsy: User management complete. Rewrote remote
	  logging. direct transfer via socket now instead of 'comm send
	  -async'. The latter lost messages somehow and handling of
	  incoming messages was timecritical. The new thing works
	  a-ok. Next thing to do: Complete popeye, add management tools
	  there too.

Thu Jun 26 20:47:09 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/popsymon: Started with user management.
	
	* net/pop3/server.tcl: Changed some log messages to help popsymon
	  (texts, levels used).

	* net/popsymon: Graphical monitor of popsy server. Started
	  yesterday, monitoring capabilities now complete.

	* gui/log.cls: Added recoloring of message levels.

Tue Jun 24 19:45:03 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* gui/log.cls: new widget to log messages into. usable in
	  conjunction with syslog. Taken from 'tkautodoc', enhanced and
	  put into a class. 

	* net/popsy_man: New application. Small commandline oriented
	  tool to manage a running popsy.

	* net/adb.tcl, net/mboxman.tcl: Added features required by a more
	  rich implementation of popsy (user/mailbox management).

Mon Jun 23 23:53:13 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* net/pop3/client.tcl, server.tcl, top.tcl, login_user.tcl,
	  login_apop.tcl, retrieve.tcl, net/server.tcl,
	  net/sequencer.tcl, net/mboxman.tcl: First tests of pop3 server,
	  client. Removed various bugs.
	
Mon Jun 16 23:50:57 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* net/pop3/client.tcl: Worked at implementation again, completed.

Tue Jun 10 19:15:18 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* net/pop3/client.tcl: Started implementation of pop3 client. The
	  core, that is.

	* net/mboxman.tcl: Management of directory based
	  mailboxes. 'mbox_exec' can be used directly in the '-storage'
	  callback of the pop3 core below. Started yesterday, complete
	  now, with exception of documentation.

Mon Jun  9 19:19:47 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* net/adb.tcl: Mini database to map from user names to passwords
	  and storage locations. 'adb_query' can be used directly in the
	  '-userdb' callback of the pop3 core below.

	* net/pop3/server_core.tcl: First server using the
	  framework. Core code for a POP3 server. Interfaces to separate
	  authentication database (user -> pwd, storage) and mail storage
	  subsystem.

	* net/server.tcl: Framework complete.

Sun Jun  8 00:15:23 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* net/server.tcl: Framework to ease implementation of simple
	  command based servers (like pop3, imap, smtp). Incomplete.

Sat Jun  7 18:47:17 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* net/pop3/: Populated with basic transactions (open, close,
	  login, delete, retrieve).

	* base/cgi.tcl: The mixture of 'rename' and 'interp alias' to
	  switch between the various 'cgi_puts' implementations did not
	  worked right. Using 'rename' only now. Added check in
	  'close_page' to catch nesting errors of 'open/close_string'.

Fri Jun  6 00:07:49 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* apps/mail_sendfile: see below.

	* PREPARE: Added -R to 'gen_idx; to allow for indexing of
	  directory hierarchies (net/).

	* net/ns/client.tcl (ns_revoke, ns_lookup): added forgotten
	  catches, messed up nesting of parentheses.

	* log/syslog.tcl: changed to support multiple vectors, one for
	  each possible message level.

	* apps/nwho: Query name server for registered applications.

	* apps/nserver: New application, nameserver, uses net/ns/*.

	* net/ns/*: Added mini name service, built on top of Comm
	  (by J. R. LoVerso). 

	* log/syslog.tcl: Added _syslog_log_stderr, syslog_stderr to allow
	  for easy setup of standard logging mechanism.

	* clock/date.cls (next/prev): Added info about dangers inherent in
	  the routine (DST +2 instead of +1), missing days. Maybe an
	  explicit library should be created instead of using 'clock'.
	  See Netnewsgroup 'comp.lang.tcl', message-id's
