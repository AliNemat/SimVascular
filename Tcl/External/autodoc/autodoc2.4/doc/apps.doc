par "
Two applications are distributed, [strong autodoc] and [strong tkautodoc].
The difference between them is that [strong autodoc] starts scanning immediately,
[strong tkautodoc] on the other hand pops up a graphical interface, allowing for
interactive redefinition of some options before the start of the scan.
"

par "General invocation of both is as [strong "(tk)autodoc ?-option value?..."]."
par "Recognized options are:"

definitionList {
    defterm -v {

	the generated uplink or not. Ignored if no text was given, the
	image has to be the link in such a case.
    }

    defterm -exclude {
	A list of glob patterns. All files with names matching at
	least one of the patterns will be excluded from the scan and

These definitions take precedence over the hardwired defaults, but can be
overridden by the command line.
