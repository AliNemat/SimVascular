Extraction of documentation embedded into tcl code and its conversion to HTML.

This directory contains an application to convert specially formatted documentation
embedded into tcl code into a cross-referenced set of HTML pages describing the code.


For a simple install just unpack into a directory of your choice, make it your
working directory, then type 'make install'. This will install the application
into /usr/local/bin, its package  will go into a subdirectory of /usr/local/lib.
You must be root to do the last step, of course.


For a nonstandard installation you have to edit the Makefile, just point
$exec_dir to a directory of your choice (Tcl should search it for
packages). Alternatively change $BIN_DIR and $LIB_DIR.
