Hello world,

I hereby announce autodoc 2.4.
It is 
	An application to convert specially formatted documentation
	embedded into tcl code into a cross-referenced set of
	HTML pages describing this code.
    

Changes from 2.3 to 2.4

*	File names and anchors are now derived from the name of the
	original object and much less subject to change than before.

*	Additional tags: @bug, @date, @version and @example (@ex)

*	Support for [incr Tcl] (and [incr Tk]: components, options).

*	Information about inheritance automatically grafted to
	method descriptions.

*	New index listing all used namespaces.

*	Better support for superclasses defined outside of the
	documented package.

*	Added support for CSS. The styles.css file coming with the
	distribution was written by Sebastien BARRE
	<sebastien@barre.nom.fr>.

*	Forward and backward links for the sections in a class
	description.
