Changes from 2.3 to 2.4

*	File names and anchors are now derived from the name of the
	original object and much less subject to change than before.

*	Additional tags: @bug, @date, @version and @example (@ex)

*	Support for [incr Tcl] (and [incr Tk]: components, options).

*	Information about inheritance automatically grafted to
	method descriptions.

*	New index listing all used namespaces.

*	Better support for superclasses defined outside of the
	documented package.

*	Added support for CSS. The styles.css file coming with the
	distribution was written by Sebastien BARRE
	<sebastien@barre.nom.fr>.

*	Forward and backward links for the sections in a class
	description.


Changes from 2.2 to 2.3

*	Added an option to exclude files from the processing based
	upon their names (glob patterns).

Changes from 2.1 to 2.2

*	Squashed several bugs (with help from Laurent Duperval
	<laurent.duperval@cgi.ca>).

*	Minor enhancements ('sample', 'emph' formatting commands)

Changes from 2.0 to 2.1

*	Using a new feature in the object system of Pool, nested
	objects (objects which are placed in the namespace of
	another object). Advantages: Better encapsulation of private
	information, less conflicts possible, simpler cleanup.

	*NOTE*
	Because of this, this distribution now depends on Pool
	version 2.2

*	Some bugfixes.

Changes from 1.0 to 2.0

*	Updated to the changes made in Pool (1.0 -> 2.0, OO kernel).

*	Factored out the HTML generating part and inserted API allowing other
	generators in the future (text, SGML, ...)

*	Updated HTML generator to changes between cgi 0.4 and 0.7
	(cgi_anchor_name semantics changed). Cannot be used with cgi 0.4
	anymore, at least 0.7 is required.

*	Simplified interface between autodoc and '.doc' and '.predoc' files.

*	Changes in recognized commands:

	<>	Replaced @member/@m with @var/@v.
		Still recognizes the old forms and marks them as errors.

*	Changes in cross referencing

	<>	Added <x ..> as shortcut of <xref ..>.
	<>	Added <v ..> and <var ..> to allow references to member
		variables.
	<>	Added <i ..> and <img ..> to allow references to images
		(as defined in '.predoc' files).
	<>	Enhanced method, option and variable references to allow
		references without a classname. The class enclosing the
		reference is automatically used.
	<>	Changed the separator character used by method, option and
		variable references from '/' to ':'. Still recognizes the
		old forms and marks them as errors.
	<>	Removed <e ..> and <ext>, recognizes <d ..> and <dep ..>
		instead (external DEPendencies). Still recognizes the old
		forms and marks them as errors.

Changes from 0.5 to 1.0

*	None, just a code freeze for Pool 1.0. The next version
	will require Pool 2.0.

Changes from 0.4 to 0.5

*	Corrected logical error preventing the system to work
	without a 'pkg.doc'

*	'lib/pkg.doc' is now part of the distribution to allow
	it to operate on itself.

*	Fixed some 'string vs. list'-hacks which were able to
	blow up the system under tcl 8.x in case of comments
	containing unmatched braces.


Changes from 0.3 to 0.4

*	Generated pages now contain backreference to the generator
	documentation. Idea from 'latex2html'.

*	Now works with tcl 8.0 too (':' allowed in identifiers).

*	Better generation of author references (mailto).

*	Class members and options (parameters) can have documentation
	now too.

*	Fixed anchor-problems.


Changes from 0.2 to 0.3

*	Now tracking 'package require's.
	Generated documentation may contain urls referencing required
	packages (source, doc, ...).

	Always contains a reverse index mapping from required packages
	to the files using them.

*	Missing documentation is highlighted now, and reachable via a
	special summary page.

*	Added alternative output format for procedure definitions.
	Definition list and table (new) formatting available now.
