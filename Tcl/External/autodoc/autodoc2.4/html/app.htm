The difference between them is that <b>autodoc</b> starts scanning immediately,<b>tkautodoc</b> on the other hand pops up a graphical interface, allowing for
interactive redefinition of some options before the start of the scan.</p><p>General invocation of both is as <b>(tk)autodoc ?-option value?...</b>.</p><p>Recognized options are:</p><dl><dt>-v <dd>Possible values are 0 and 1. If set to 1 the values of all
options are written to stdout. Defaults to 0.<dt>-srcdir <dd>The directory containing the distribution to be documented.
Defaults to the current working directory.<dt>-outputdir <dd>The directory to write the generated HTML pages into. Defaults
to subdirectory 'html' of the current working directory. Will
be made, if not in existence already.<dt>-tables <dd>Possible values are 0 and 1. Has effect only if the distribution
contains '.doc'-files generating additional pages. Influences the
layout of the homepage. If set to 1 distribution description and
links to the additional pages are placed side by side. Otherwise
the additional links are placed below the description. Defaults
to 0.<dt>-replyaddr <dd>The mail-address used at the bottom of every page. Defaults to <b>[logname]@[info hostname]</b>. 'logname' is defined
in the package <a href="http://www.oche.de/~akupries/soft/pool/index.htm" class="xref-dep">Pool_Base</a>.<dt>-psort <dd>Possible values are 0 and 1. Determines wether procedure/method
definitions of a file/class are written alphabetically sorted (1),
or in the order encountered during the scan (0). Defaults to 1.<dt>-ptable <dd>Possible values are 0 and 1. Determines wether procedure/method
definitions of a file/class are written as table (1) or definition
list (0). Defaults to 1.<dt>-up-link <dd>The url to use as target in the uplink to the site containing
the generated documentation. Ignored if neither -up-title nor
-up-image is set.<dt>-up-title <dd>The string to use in the uplink to the site containing the
generated documentation.<dt>-up-image <dd>The symbolic name of the image to use in the uplink to the
site containing the generated documentation, as defined with a
call <b>imgDef</b>.<dt>-up-imglink <dd>A boolean flag. Determines wether the image is made a part of
the generated uplink or not. Ignored if no text was given, the
image has to be the link in such a case.<dt>-exclude <dd>A list of glob patterns. All files with names matching at
least one of the patterns will be excluded from the scan and
documentation processing. This option takes effect while the
system is searching for files to document and while searching
for additional .doc and .predoc files.<dt>-clisttype <dd>Either one of <b>comma</b> or <b>par</b>. Defines the
appearance of the lists used in classes to reference
superclasses, options, methods and member variables.<dt>-no-problems <dd>Boolean option. If set the system will not write the
accumulated problem reports / pages. It will still write that
there are problems and how many, if any. Default is 0 == no
supression.<dt>-css <dd>Boolean option to control support for cascading style sheets
(CSS). Support is enabled by default.<dt>-fsort-fullpath <dd>Boolean option. If set the listing of files in their index is
sorted by their full path. Else the first letter of the real
filename (directories stripped).<dt>-file-prefix <dd>In effect only if -fsort-fullpath is set. Defines a prefix to
remove from the path before taking the first letter.<dt>-class-prefix <dd>Defines a prefix to remove from the namespace of a class
before taking the first letter.<dt>-proc-prefix <dd>Defines a prefix to remove from the namespace of a procedure
before taking the first letter.<dt>-namespace-prefix <dd>Defines a prefix to remove from the namespace of a namespace
before taking the first letter.<dt>-itk-opt-alias <dd>The name of a custom command found in the code to scan and
equivalent to <b>itk_options</b>.</dl><p>Both applications read the file '.autodocrc' in the home directory of the
caller, if present, and incorporate any option-values defined in it.
These definitions take precedence over the hardwired defaults, but can be
overridden by the command line.</p><hr><p class="generated-by">Generated by <a href="http://www.oche.de/~akupries/soft/autodoc/index.htm" class="generated-by">AutoDoc 2.4</a> at 09/07/2000, invoked by <a href="mailto:a.kupries@westend.com" class="generated-by">Andreas Kupries</a></p></body></html>
