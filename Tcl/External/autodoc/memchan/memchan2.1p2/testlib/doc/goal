Write an application to

-	run an existing test suite without changes
	(but from the outside of the package, not
	as part of it)

	=> backward compatibility required.


-	provide a graphical interface to all tests
	in a suite, allowing the user to look at them,
	enable and/or disable them, see their state
	at a glance.

-	allow an user to write / modify tests
	=> management of test suites
	=> editor for a test suite.

Additionals

-	Define a new format for tests, allowing the
	additional specification of setup/cleanup scripts
	and dependencies between tests.

-	needs support from the make system for proper
	operation ((un/re)loading of the package to test)
